## Thanos là gì?
- Thanos provides a global query view, data backup, and historical data access as its core features in a single binary. All three features can be run independently of each other. This allows you to have a subset of Thanos features ready for immediate benefit or testing, while also making it flexible for gradual roll outs in more complex environments.
- In this quick-start guide, we will configure Thanos and all components mentioned to work against an object storage cloud provider. Thanos is able to use different storage providers, with the ability to add more providers as necessary. Thanos will work in cloud native environments as well as more traditional ones. Some users run Thanos in Kubernetes while others on bare metal.
